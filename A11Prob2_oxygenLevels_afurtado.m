%% INITIALIZATION
%import data set

temp = Data_DO_concentrations(:,1);%Temperature (Â°C)
O2_conc = Data_DO_concentrations(:,2);%Concentration of Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L)

%% REGRESSION CALCULATIONS
x_squared = temp.^2; 
xy = temp.*O2_conc;
x_bar = mean(temp);

a = (product_x_bar_y_bar - xy_bar)/(x_bar_squared-x_squared_bar); %slope
b = y_bar - a*x_bar; %y-intercept
least_squares_model = a.*temp + b;

SSE = sum((O2_conc - least_squares_model).^2); 
SST = sum((O2_conc - y_bar).^2);
r_squared = 1 - SSE/SST;

%% PREDICTION CALCULATIONS
%predict the Concentration of Dissolved Oxygen at 17 deg C and 45 deg C
%at 17 deg C
O2_conc_17C = a*17 + b;%mg/L
%at 45 deg C
O2_conc_45C = a*45 +b;%mg/L
